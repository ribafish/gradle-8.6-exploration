# Gradle 8.6 Exploration

This repository demonstrates many, but not all, of the new features introduced in Gradle 8.6.

Each directory has a Gradle project that explores a new feature or improvement.
Where possible, a directory may also contain an example Gradle project that shows the behavior in a previous version.

Some directories have a `run.sh` file that sets up and executes the example(s).
Other directories may need to be opened up and inspected from an IDE.

Familiarity with the release notes is expected.
